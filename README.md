# Deep-Learning---Gesture-Recognition

#*Problem Statement*

Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.
The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

#Gesture Corresponding Action
1. Thumbs Up Increase the volume.
2. Thumbs Down Decrease the volume.
3. Left Swipe 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds.
4. Right Swipe 'Jump' forward 10 seconds.
5. Stop Pause the movie.

#*Solution*

Developed two models (3D Covnvolutional and Cov2D+RNN )that are able to give good accuracy on the least number of parameters.
